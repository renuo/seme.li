Installation is as easy as clicking this button.

> **Warning**
> Be aware though that you'll
[loose your SQLite database often](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem)
if you use Heroku. You may want to hook into a Postgres database
or use [Dokku with a volume](https://dokku.com/docs/advanced-usage/persistent-storage/).
on your own server.
Sticking to a SQLite database also means that you can run on 1 "dyno" only.
